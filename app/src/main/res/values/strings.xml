    <string name="research_consent_text">This application is created as a data-gathering platform for a Master\'s thesis project. The goal of this research is to establish whether it is possible to identify a user\'s gender and handedness based on their touch gestures. \n \n Participation in this research is voluntary and the user can choose to not accept these terms. Data is only recorded after the user\'s approval. This application includes functionality with which the user can request the removal of the data associated with their current user session. \n \n The gestures performed within this application are recorded and stored on a remote database. Gesture data is associated with the user\'s personal data - gender and handedness - which the user indicates on the following screens. No other information besides the user\'s gender and handedness are requested. Personal data is required in order to correctly categorize the recorded gestures.\n Furthermore, the user\'s device screen size and resolution are stored. The information inferred from the gathered data is not associated with a user nor is it permanently stored. \n \n All the aforementioned data is associated with an anonymous, randomly generated user identifier, and as such the data cannot be related to a person. \n \n If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please contact Matti Mäki-Kihniä for further information (matti.maki-kihnia@aalto.fi). \n \n</string>
